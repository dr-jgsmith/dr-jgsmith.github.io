My name is Justin Smith, and I am an Assistant Professor of Community & Economic Development at [Washington State University](http://wsu.edu/). I work as an applied research scientist with the [Metropolitan Center for Applied Research and Extension](https://metrocenter.wsu.edu/) @ WSU. 

## Research Interests

I am pretty much obsessed with computational approaches to modeling and understanding human behavior. I am particularly interested in the combined role of social sensing systems, and artificial intelligence to enhance human decision making for social and ecological resilience. Much of my work focuses on building sensing and decision-support systems for government, business and other scholars.
