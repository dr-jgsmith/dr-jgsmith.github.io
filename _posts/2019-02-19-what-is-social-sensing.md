title: What is social sensing?
---

'Social sensing'  generally refers to software systems that integrate multiple data sources such as passive smartphone sensor data (e.g. GPS, accelerometers) with active data such as social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), and open government data ([Aggarwal & Abdelzaher 2013](https://www3.nd.edu/~dwang5/courses/spring15/papers/intro/socialsense.pdf); [Wang, Abdelzaher, & Kaplan 2015](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=o-OcBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=social+sensing&ots=5q3KlC6Lsb&sig=Es7Vtl34JhkMcJTPq_0Afiwt9Ys)) in order to characterize some set of social states for a given community. Communities can be defined as communities of place, communities of practice, as well as more cultural communities. These delineations form a way to organize and direct an overwhelming volume of social data.
