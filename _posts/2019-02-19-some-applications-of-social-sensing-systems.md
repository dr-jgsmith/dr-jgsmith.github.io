categories:

Social sensing systems can be used to monitor social states and trends associated with places and communities over time. These data can be used to: 

- characterize health behaviors, 
- track and monitor movement of narcotics, 
- monitor the state of critical infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges), 
- monitor relations between social states in media and behavior in financial markets, 
- gauge public sentiment to public policy solutions,
- monitor challenges that disrupt community well-being

The applications are many, and new uses are continuously being developed and explored. I am particularly interested in the application of social sensing systems as a way to assess and improve the social and ecological resilience of urban communities. 

Overall, social sensing has powerful applications (and implications) in law enforcement, community and economic development, business and marketing, and more.  In terms of monitoring cultural or political communities, social sensing systems can be used to track significant political issues, the rise and evolution of ideologies, and more. 

Additionally, social sensing systems can be extended to include decision-support tools that support complex decision making with big data.
