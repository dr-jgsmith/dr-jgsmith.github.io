## Welcome

[The Social Sensing Notebook](https://dr-jgsmith.github.io) is primarily an open research notebook related to social and community sensing. It is also meant to be an information resource for researchers and software developers interested in developing social sensing and decision-support systems. These resources include code, data and theoretical perspectives on social sensing and decision-making systems. It is also a reminder for myself. 

> Note: All the tools and data referenced here are open and free for use.

For the most part, I focus on a specific type of social sensing which can be termed as 'community sensing.'
