## Welcome to the Community Sensing Notebook

[The Community Sensing Notebook](https://dr-jsmith.github.io) is primarily an open research notebook related to social and community sensing. It is also meant to be an information resource for researchers and software developers interested in developing social (or 'community') sensing and decision-support systems. These resources include code, data and theoretical perspectives on social sensing and decision-making systems. It is also a reminder for myself. 

> Note: All the tools and data referenced here are open and free for use.

For the most part, I focus on a specific type of social sensing which can be termed as 'community sensing.'

## What is community sensing?

Like 'social sensing', community sensing generally refers to software systems that integrate multiple data sources such as passive smartphone sensor data (e.g. GPS, accelerometers) with active data such as social media and open government data (cite). 

Community sensing systems are a specific type of social sensing that often leverage similar data infrastructure, but focus on characterizing communities of place for applications in sustainable urban planning and design. Of course, the concept of community can be modified to include cultural or political communities that exist across multiple geographies. Examples can include scientific communities, lifestyle communities, arts and more.

## What are the uses?

Community sensing systems can be used to monitor events, and trends over time, identify needed repairs to critical infrastructure, as well as monitor hot spots from illegal activity. And these are just a few of the applications. Other uses can include collecting feedback regarding government or business services. I am particularly interested in the use of community sensing systems as a way to assess and improve community resilience, and more specifically the social and ecological resilience of the geographic places people call home.

Overall, community sensing has powerful applications (and implications) in law enforcement, community and economic development, business and marketing, and more.  In terms of monitoring cultural or political communities, community sensing systems can be used to track significant political issues, ideologies and more. Moreover, sensing systems can be extended to include decision-support tools that support complex decision making with big data, which amounts to defining a new (and potentially dangerous) relationship between humans and machines in the decision-making.
